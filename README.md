# KeyValuePairParser
The key value pair pasers is a Arduino C++ library that takes serialised key value pair data and seperates the pairs into tokens. 
The tokens are then parsed into global varaibles. Parsing into global variables might not be the best options. 
The intentions of the library is to be thread safe and work with FreeRTOS.
